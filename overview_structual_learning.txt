Dimensionality and Structured Models:
- Nearest Neighbor doesn't fit well when data is high dimensional.
- Spine smoothing
- 10% of data points in each interval.
- Linear and Quadratic model.
Quadratic models fits well compared to Linear.
- Under-fit, Overfit models.
- Prediction accuracy vs interpretablity comparsion amonth different models.

Model Selection and Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Bias-Variance tradeoff
Flexibility increases, variance increases and bias decreases

Classification:
- Bayes Optimal Classifier:
The classifier that classifies to the class for which the conditional
probability for that element of the class is largest.
Misclassification error:
C(xi) = Predicted values != Actual Value
Sum of C(xi)

K-nearest neighbors in two dimensions
K = (1,2,...10)
Get (K=10) values in the radius and ratio of class1 and class2 is calculated. The one with higher ratio is predicted.
Decision boundary: where probability of two classes are same.

### Learned the Statistical course which includes following topics:
**Supervised Learning:**
- Linear and Polynomial regression
- Logistic regression
- Linear Discriminant analysis(LDA)
- Cross-validation
- Bootstrap
- Resampling methods
- Model selection
- Regularization methods(ridge and lasso)
- Tree based methods such as random forests, boosting
- Support Vector Machines(SVM)

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Principal components
- K-means
- Breast Cancer dataset is used

The **R** programming language is used for implementation during the lab sessions.
This course basically covers the concepts of book **An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with applications in R** by **Rob Tibshirani, Trevor Hastie and Daniela Witten**

The session includes Video tutorial for each topic followed by Quiz/MCQ questions, some involves coding as well.

This course helped me in getting in-depth understanding of various Supervised and Unsupervised learning methods. The lab exercises are really helpful for the practical implementation of methods.

Assignments and code is downloaded from the Stanford Online Course.

I would like to thanks **Rob Tibshirani, Trevor Hastie and Daniela Witten** for great tutorials.
